One easy route for all the night light displays

With two night light-up events happening around the same time in the Civic District – [Light to Night Festival](https://www.nationalgallery.sg/festivals/light-to-night-traces-and-echoes) and [I Light Singapore](https://www.ilightsingapore.sg/), and more than 40 works of art on display, things might get a little overwhelming. Perhaps you are wondering which event you should go for, with your packed schedule. The good news is, you don’t have to choose.

We’ve come up with a single, simple route that will bring you through all the must-see artworks in the Light to Night Festival, an urban art festival organised by the National Gallery of Singapore, and I Light Singapore, a sustainable light art festival presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority.

Here’s the route: Start your journey in Marina Bay Sands at the Helix Bridge with **The Time Vortex** (above), a light work that makes the bridge appear like a portal to the future.

Continue down the Marina Bay Waterfront where you will come across **Prospegtive Perspective** (above), a sculpture made from transparent clothes pegs, which frames the Marina Bay skyline and makes for an attractive picture. Don’t miss **Sails Aloft** on the water, a holographic art installation inspired by a 19th century sailboat.

Turn the corner from the waterfront promenade to The Promontory @ Marina Bay and be dazzled by the scale and spectacle of the **Squiggle** (above), where 200 metres of digital neon tubes light up the landscape. Keep walking towards the lawn next to One Marina Boulevard, where **Les Footballeurs** is; the lighting creates the visual effect of a footballer and goalkeeper in action.

Turn the corner again and walk along the waterfront to One Fullerton, where you will find the **Flower Clock** – made up of rotating, illuminated dials that bring to mind flowers spinning around. Continue towards the Esplanade and duck under the Esplanade Bridge, for **TIME FRAME | DONIS** (above), a majestic projection of real-time information about Singapore in the form of attention-grabbing text and numbers.

Cross the Singapore River and head towards the Asian Civilisations Museum Green and be mesmerised by **Resonance**, a glittering tunnel, and **Sticks** (above) a large-scale sculpture inspired by the childhood game of pick-up sticks.

Head towards Boat Quay, along the Singapore River promenade, for **With A View** (above) outside Parliament House. Mirrors, shaped like shophouse windows, are used to create the illusion of the windows receding into an infinite distance. The Elgin Bridge has **Run Beyond** on its façade, which shows a stop-motion like play of a man making a jump, and **Good Fortune**, at its underpass, which brings to mind larger-than-life raindrops. Nearby is **Constructive Interference**; stand on one end, peer through the misaligned square and rectangle frames, and get someone to snap a portrait picture for you.

Finish up at the National Gallery Singapore with **Secret of the Sand, Written in the Stars, Snapshots in Time** (above), a specially commissioned façade projection that includes key moments, stories and memories in Singapore’s 700-year history.
