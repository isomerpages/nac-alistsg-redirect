**Nothing is Forever: When Flowers Fade by Chowk Productions feat. Damaru (Resonates With Residency)**

![Event1]()

In their second performance for the _Resonates With Residency_, Chowk will respond to the section of the [_Nothing is Forever_](https://www.nationalgallery.sg/nothingisforever) exhibition that looks at “The Corporeal”, particularly at _Cloud of '68_ by Tang Da Wu. 

Just as Tang experimented with using ephemeral elements in sculpture, Chowk will explore the ephemeral nature of live performance, and how “Nothing is Forever.” They will be accompanied by musicians from Damaru, Singapore's school of traditional Indian drumming.

**Performance details:  
**2.30–3pm | 4–4.30pm  
Level 1 and B1, Padang Atrium

About _Resonates With Residency_
--------------------------------

The _Resonates With Residency_ is a three-month programme that invites local artists to respond to works and themes from the Gallery’s long-term and special exhibitions. Each Resident Artist will explore a theme—inspired by an ongoing exhibition— through a series of performances, public workshops, and online content. With interdisciplinary, intercultural, and international collaboration at its core, the _Resonates With Residency_ aims to establish deep and meaningful connections between artists, audiences, and art from Singapore and the region.

_**Alchemy: Stone to Flesh**_ is a dancer's reading of the exhibition, [_Nothing is Forever: Rethinking Sculpture in Singapore_](https://www.nationalgallery.sg/nothingisforever). There is a centuries-old relationship between sculpture and the classical dances of India. Throughout the subcontinent, dance forms like Odissi have inspired countless craftspeople to create reliefs, stone carvings, idols and statues for temples, palaces, and even ordinary homes. The inspiration flowed the other way too, as performers created dances in response to sculptures. For example, the temple sculptures and reliefs in Orissa are associated with some of the basic stances in Odissi. During their residency, Chowk Productions—in collaboration with other artists—will explore the manifold ways that the language of dance can be used to interpret sculpture. Transformation is key to life and art; we have to embrace the fact that nothing is forever.
