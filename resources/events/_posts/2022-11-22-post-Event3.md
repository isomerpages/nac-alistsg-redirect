Delve into an expanded account of sculptural practices since the 19th century in _Nothing is Forever: Rethinking Sculpture in Singapore_. Featuring over 70 works, this is the first critical exploration of sculpture in three decades told through artistic concerns that range from the monumental and the spiritual, to the corporeal and performative, as well as the shifting notions of the object in the making of sculpture. The exhibition seeks to reveal the changing roles of sculptors as tensions between fine art and craft, the permanence of art and its ephemerality continue to be surfaced.
